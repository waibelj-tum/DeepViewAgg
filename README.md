This Project is based on https://github.com/drprojects/DeepViewAgg

## Requirements :memo:
The following must be installed before installing this project.
- Anaconda3
- cuda >= 11.6
- gcc >= 7

All remaining dependencies (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, etc) should be installed using the provided [installation script](init.sh).
For using the point transformer layer follow instruction in https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/point-transformer

The code has been tested in the following environment:
- Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
- Python 3.7.9
- PyTorch 1.12.0
- CUDA 11.6
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10G
- 64G RAM


## Disclaimer
This is **not the official [Torch-Points3D](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d) framework**. This work builds on and modifies a fixed version of the framework and has not been merged with the official repository yet. In particular, this repository **introduces numerous features for multimodal learning on large-scale 3D point clouds**. In this repository, some TP3D-specific files were removed for simplicity. 

## Project structure
The project follows the original [Torch-Points3D framework](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d) structure.
